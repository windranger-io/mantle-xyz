        , the community has approved the merger of BitDAO and Mantle. The new
        native token will be $MNT with usecases for Mantle Network gas fees and
        Mantle Governance voting. $BIT will be delisted on exchanges and
        replaced with $MNT trading pairs. Eventually all $BIT will be migrated
        to $MNT.

        Yes, most users will be refunded their cost of migration in ETH. Users
